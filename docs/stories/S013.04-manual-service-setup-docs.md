# Story: Document Manual Service Setup

**Story ID:** S013.04 **Epic:**
[E013 - Deployment Infrastructure](../epic/E013-deployment-infrastructure.md)
**Status:** Draft **Priority:** P3 **Estimated Points:** 1

## Description

As a user who prefers manual control, I want documentation explaining how to set
up the daemon as a system service by hand, So that I can customize the service
configuration or troubleshoot issues with the automated install.

## Context

Some users prefer to manage service files manually rather than using
`acd service install`. This story provides documentation covering both macOS
(launchd) and Linux (systemd) manual setup, including common troubleshooting
steps.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

1. Write a markdown guide covering manual setup for both platforms
2. Include copy-paste commands for each step
3. Document common issues and troubleshooting
4. Reference the plist and unit file created in S013.01/S013.02

### Files to Create

- `docs/guides/manual-service-setup.md` — manual setup documentation

### Dependencies

- [S013.01 - macOS launchd Plist](./S013.01-macos-launchd-plist.md) — plist file
  to reference
- [S013.02 - Linux systemd Unit File](./S013.02-linux-systemd-unit-file.md) —
  unit file to reference

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documentation covers macOS launchd manual setup
- [ ] Documentation covers Linux systemd manual setup
- [ ] Each step includes copy-paste shell commands
- [ ] Troubleshooting section covers common issues
- [ ] Links to service files in the repository

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Manual test: follow macOS instructions from scratch
- [ ] Manual test: follow Linux instructions from scratch
- [ ] Peer review of documentation clarity

## Out of Scope

- Windows service setup
- Docker/container deployment
- Automated testing of documentation steps
