# Story: Add Daemon Auto-Start Capability

**Story ID:** S001.04 **Epic:**
[E001 - Daemon Core Infrastructure](../epic/E001-daemon-core-infrastructure.md)
**Status:** Draft **Priority:** P2 **Estimated Points:** 3

## Description

As a client (hook or dashboard), I want the daemon to start automatically if
it's not running, So that I don't have to manually start the daemon before using
the system.

## Context

For a seamless user experience, clients should not need to manually start the
daemon. When a hook fires or a dashboard launches, if the daemon isn't running,
it should be started automatically. This is the "first client starts the daemon"
pattern.

The auto-start behavior ensures:

- Zero manual setup for users
- Hooks work immediately after installation
- Dashboard can be launched at any time
- System is self-healing (daemon crash = auto-restart on next use)

Combined with the 60-minute auto-stop timeout (per
[D5](../architecture/2026-01-31-discussion-decisions.md)), the daemon lifecycle
becomes fully automatic with proper debouncing.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

1. Create client connection helper in `client/connection.rs`
2. Implement connection attempt with auto-start logic
3. Check if daemon is running (try to connect to socket)
4. If connection fails, spawn daemon process in background (`--daemonize`)
5. Wait for daemon to be ready (retry connection with exponential backoff)
6. Return connected client after daemon is available
7. Add timeout to prevent infinite wait if spawn fails

### Files to Create/Modify

- `crates/agent-console-dashboard/src/client/mod.rs` - Client module with
  auto-start logic
- `crates/agent-console-dashboard/src/client/connection.rs` - Connection
  handling with auto-start

### Dependencies

- S001.01: Daemon process must support `--daemonize` flag
- S001.02: Unix socket server must be operational

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given no daemon running, when a client attempts to connect, then the
      daemon is started automatically
- [ ] Given daemon just started, when client connects, then connection succeeds
      after daemon is ready
- [ ] Given daemon already running, when a client connects, then no new daemon
      is spawned
- [ ] Given auto-start is triggered, when daemon spawns, then it runs in
      background (daemonized)
- [ ] Given daemon fails to start, when timeout is reached, then client gets
      clear error message
- [ ] Given multiple clients try to connect simultaneously, when no daemon
      running, then only one daemon is started (handled via socket file lock)

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Integration test: Client auto-starts daemon when not running
- [ ] Integration test: Second client connects without spawning another daemon
- [ ] Integration test: Connection succeeds after daemon startup delay
- [ ] Integration test: Timeout error when daemon cannot start
- [ ] Integration test: Race condition handling for simultaneous connections
      (multiple clients should safely try to spawn daemon)

## Out of Scope

- Systemd/launchd service files (user manages service themselves if they want
  persistent daemon)
- Daemon health monitoring/restart (crash = restart on next use)
- Multiple daemon instances (single instance design with socket lock)

### Implementation Pattern

```rust
pub async fn connect_with_auto_start(socket_path: &Path) -> Result<Client> {
    // Try to connect first
    match UnixStream::connect(socket_path).await {
        Ok(stream) => return Ok(Client::new(stream)),
        Err(_) => {
            // Daemon not running, try to start it
            spawn_daemon(socket_path)?;

            // Wait for daemon to be ready with exponential backoff
            let mut delay = Duration::from_millis(10);
            for _ in 0..10 {
                tokio::time::sleep(delay).await;
                if let Ok(stream) = UnixStream::connect(socket_path).await {
                    return Ok(Client::new(stream));
                }
                delay = (delay * 2).min(Duration::from_millis(500));
            }

            Err(Error::DaemonStartFailed)
        }
    }
}

fn spawn_daemon(socket_path: &Path) -> Result<()> {
    Command::new(current_exe()?)
        .args(["daemon", "--daemonize", "--socket", socket_path.to_str()?])
        .spawn()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Timeout and Retry Configuration

| Parameter           | Value        |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| Initial retry delay | 10ms         |
| Max retry delay     | 500ms        |
| Max retries         | 10           |
| Total max wait      | ~2.6 seconds |

### Auto-Start + Auto-Stop Interaction

Per [D5](../architecture/2026-01-31-discussion-decisions.md), the 60-minute
auto-stop timeout means:

- Daemon won't be rapidly created/deleted
- Socket file lifecycle is clean (removed on shutdown per D6)
- Auto-start provides natural debouncing for intermittent usage patterns

### Race Condition Handling

If multiple clients try to auto-start simultaneously, each will call
`spawn_daemon()`. The socket file acts as a natural lock:

- First spawned daemon creates the socket successfully
- Other spawned daemons fail to bind (address in use) and exit
- All clients retry connecting until one daemon succeeds

This is safe and requires no additional locking.
