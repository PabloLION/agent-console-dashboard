# Story: ~~Implement API_USAGE Command~~ (Cut)

**Story ID:** S009.02 **Epic:**
[E009 - API Usage Tracking](../epic/E009-api-usage-tracking.md) **Status:** Cut
**Priority:** — **Estimated Points:** —

## Status

This story was **cut** from E009. The revised epic architecture has the TUI call
`claude_usage::get_usage()` directly, bypassing the daemon. No IPC commands for
usage data are needed.

See [E009 epic](../epic/E009-api-usage-tracking.md) "What Was Removed" section
for rationale.
