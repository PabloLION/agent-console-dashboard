{"id":"acd-i4o","title":"Deep content audit of all 55 story files","description":"## Context\n\nStructural audit completed on 2026-01-30 (see docs/audits/2026-01-30-story-structural-audit.md).\nAll files pass structural validation (docs/docs-scripts/validate-stories.sh).\nThis task covers the CONTENT quality review that was not yet done.\n\n## Branch\n\nContinue on: docs/create-missing-stories\n\n## What to Check Per Story File\n\nFor each of the 55 story files in docs/stories/:\n\n1. **Description quality**: Clear user story format (\"As a..., I want..., So that...\")\n2. **Context section**: Explains WHY this story exists, not just WHAT\n3. **Implementation Details accuracy**: Files to modify/create match actual codebase structure\n   - Check paths like `src/daemon/server.rs` vs `crates/agent-console-dashboard/src/daemon/server.rs`\n   - Flag any paths that reference non-existent modules\n4. **Acceptance criteria**: Testable, specific, not vague\n5. **Dependencies**: Cross-references to other stories are accurate (correct story IDs, correct relationship)\n6. **Scope consistency with epic**: Story scope matches what the parent epic describes\n7. **Points estimation**: Reasonable relative to other stories (1=trivial, 2=small, 3=medium, 5=large)\n8. **Code examples**: If present, check they use correct crate/module names\n9. **Out of scope**: Items listed make sense and aren't things that should be in scope\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Read stories in epic order (E001 stories first, then E002, etc.)\n2. Read the parent epic first to understand goals\n3. Review each story against the checklist above\n4. Record findings per file in docs/audits/2026-01-30-story-content-audit.md\n5. Fix issues found\n6. Commit fixes\n\n## Already Verified (Do NOT Re-check)\n\n- File existence (all present)\n- Header format (Story ID, Epic link, Status, Priority, Points)\n- Required sections present (Description, Acceptance Criteria)\n- Epic links resolve to correct files\n- Epic story tables have hyperlinks\n- Sprint-status.yaml alignment\n- Story ID matches filename\n\n## Key Files\n\n- Validation script: docs/docs-scripts/validate-stories.sh\n- Structural audit: docs/audits/2026-01-30-story-structural-audit.md\n- Sprint status: planning-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"36828324+PabloLION@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-30T17:55:53.788894+01:00","created_by":"Pablo LION","updated_at":"2026-01-30T17:55:53.788894+01:00"}
